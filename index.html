    <p> Swimming is an individual or team racing sport that requires the use of one's entire body to move through water.
      ... Competitive swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports, with varied distance events in butterfly,
      backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and individual medley.Swimming is the self-propulsion of a person through
      water, or a liquid substance, usually for recreation, sport, exercise, or survival. Locomotion is achieved through
      coordinated movement of the limbs and the body.Humans can hold their breath underwater and undertake rudimentary
      locomotive swimming within weeks of birth, as a survival response.

      Swimming is consistently among the top public recreational activities and in some countries, swimming lessons are
      a compulsory part of the educational curriculum.[6] As a formalized sport, swimming features in a range of local,
      national, and international competitions, including every modern Summer Olympics. </p>
